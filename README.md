## General info
The main feature of the application is browsing the collection of approx. 5800 books which is a live representation of WebAPI from polish website https://wolnelektury.pl/. The API contains information about books' titles, authors, literary kinds, genres, availability of audio versions and url addresses for covers and thumbnail images. All the data is in polish, that is why a web user interface has been created also entirely in that language. Thanks to the use of Bootstrap's component library, the web user interface is completely responsive.

## Features

- ### User authentication and authorization
Access to individual functionalities depends on the user's authorization. The application has three levels of authorization: 
guest, user and administrator.
The Google Oauth Authentication system has been added to the application. If the user already exists in the database, he is logged into 
his account. Otherwise he is added to the database. 
Logging in verifies the user's authorization level and grants him access to individual functionalities.

- ### Browsing the list of books
User of any level of authorization is able to browse the whole collection of books. The list of books is divided into pages of 20 titles on each using a pagination feature. While hoovering over the rows of the list, books' thumbnail images pop up.

- ### Searching the books
On every page, located in the navbar is a box with a live-search function. While typing in either a title or an author's name, a list of books matching the given words pop up. Minimum three characters must be given in the search box. By clicking on a title displayed on the popped up list, a user is redirected to corresponding book's page.

- ### Filtering the list of books 
The list of books can be filtered for a specific literary kind and the availability of audio version.

- ### Displaying a single book view
By clicking on any title on the list, a user is redirected to the site where more details about the book and a cover image are displayed.

- ### Making reservations for the books
Any logged in registered user can make reservations for the books he is interested in by going to the single book view and clicking the corresponding button. In case the book is not available for reservation at the moment, the user sees the appropriate message. After making a reservation, a confirmation email is sent to the user. From a drop-down menu a user can go to the page where a list of his current reservations is displayed. Any reservation on that list can be canceled.

- ### Loading data from JSON file
In the administrator's management panel there is a functionality that allows to read all the books' data from a JSON file. All data is stored in MySQL database after loading. This functionality has been implemented as an alternative to retrieving data directly from the WebAPI in case it is not responding.

After sending a file, user gets a message whether the upload was successful or not.

- ### Adding a new book to the library
A user with administrator privileges has access to a form through which all the necessary data to create a new book in the database can be added. That also includes the possibility to upload an image that will be displayed as book's cover.
